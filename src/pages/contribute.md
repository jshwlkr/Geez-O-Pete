Submissions should include any recipe of significance, current or historical, from the state of Michigan. If it's something people keep asking for, or if it's something everyone remembers fondly from their childhood, or if it's something that's practically fed a city (or a town, or a village) then please submit it.

Please be aware submission to this website does not gaurantee a recipe will be published to the website. All recipes undergo manual review and will not likely be published immediately.

You may also use this form to submit additions/edits/etc to existing recipes or make comments or requests.

If you would like an alternate method, you may contact me directly on Twitter: [@jshwlkr](https://twitter.com/jshwlkr).
