*Geez O' Pete* is a manually curated repository of recipes submitted by various digital communities formed around the state of Michigan. The contents of this website should be available in perpetuity [in this site's repository on Github](https://github.com/jshwlkr/geez-o-pete).[^mn]

[^mn]: {-} You can find the raw text files, written in markdown, of [the recipes](https://github.com/jshwlkr/geez-o-pete/tree/main/src/posts) in src/posts.

The goal of this project is to maintain a record of community recipes outside the blackhole of places like Facebook groups or emails or private forums and allow them to exist in some publically accessible form for a long long time. The goal of this project is to keep the experiences and culture of this food from being lost.
